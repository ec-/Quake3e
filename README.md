# Quake3e

[![build](../../workflows/build/badge.svg)](../../actions?query=workflow%3Abuild) * <a href="https://discord.gg/X3Exs4C"><img src="https://img.shields.io/discord/314456230649135105?color=7289da&logo=discord&logoColor=white" alt="Discord server" /></a>

This is a modern Quake III Arena engine aimed to be fast, secure and compatible with all existing Q3A mods.
It is based on last non-SDL source dump of ioquake3 with latest upstream fixes applied.

*This repository does not contain any game content so in order to play you must copy the resulting binaries into your existing Quake III Arena installation*

**Key features**:

* optimized OpenGL renderer
* optimized Vulkan renderer
* raw mouse input support, enabled automatically instead of DirectInput(**\in_mouse 1**) if available
* unlagged mouse events processing, can be reverted by setting **\in_lagged 1**
* **\in_minimize** - hotkey for minimize/restore main window (win32-only, direct replacement for Q3Minimizer)
* **\video-pipe** - to use external ffmpeg binary as an encoder for better quality and smaller output files
* significally reworked QVM (Quake Virtual Machine)
* improved server-side DoS protection, much reduced memory usage
* raised filesystem limits (up to 20,000 maps can be handled in a single directory)
* reworked Zone memory allocator, no more out-of-memory errors
* non-intrusive support for SDL2 backend (video, audio, input), selectable at compile time
* tons of bug fixes and other improvements

## Vulkan renderer

Based on Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition with many additions:

* high-quality per-pixel dynamic lighting
* very fast flares (**\r_flares 1**)
* anisotropic filtering (**\r_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic**)
* greatly reduced API overhead (call/dispatch ratio)
* flexible vertex buffer memory management to allow loading huge maps
* multiple command buffers to reduce processing bottlenecks
* reversed depth buffer to eliminate z-fighting on big maps
* merged lightmaps (atlases)
* multitexturing optimizations
* static world surfaces cached in VBO (**\r_vbo 1**)
* useful debug markers for tools like RenderDoc
* fixed framebuffer corruption on some Intel iGPUs
* offscreen rendering, enabled with **\r_fbo 1**, all following requires it enabled:
* `screenMap` texture rendering - to create realistic environment reflections
* multisample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_multisample**)
* supersample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_supersample**)
* per-window gamma-correction which is important for screen-capture tools like OBS
* you can minimize game window any time during **\video**|**\video-pipe** recording
* high dynamic range render targets (**\r_hdr 1**) to avoid color banding
* bloom post-processing effect
* arbitrary resolution rendering
* greyscale mode

In general, not counting offscreen rendering features you might expect from 10% to 200%+ FPS increase comparing to KE's original version

Highly recommended to use on modern systems

## OpenGL renderer

Based on classic OpenGL renderers from id/ioq3/cnq3/openarena, features:

* OpenGL 1.1 compatible, uses features from newer versions whenever available
* high-quality per-pixel dynamic lighting, can be triggered by **\r_dlightMode** cvar
* merged lightmaps (atlases)
* static world surfaces cached in VBO (**\r_vbo 1**)
* all set of offscreen rendering features mentioned in Vulkan renderer, plus:
* bloom reflection post-processing effect

Performance is usually greater or equal to other opengl1 renderers

## OpenGL2 renderer

Original ioquake3 renderer, performance is very poor on non-nvidia systems, unmaintained

## Build Instructions

### windows/msvc

Install Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 or later and compile `quake3e` project from solution

`code/win32/msvc2017/quake3e.sln`

Copy resulting exe from `code/win32/msvc2017/output` directory

To compile with Vulkan backend - clean solution, right click on `quake3e` project, find `Project Dependencies` and select `renderervk` instead of `renderer`

---

### windows/mingw

All build dependencies (libraries, headers) are bundled-in

Build with either `make ARCH=x86` or `make ARCH=x86_64` commands depending on your target system, then copy resulting binaries from created `build` directory or use command:

`make install DESTDIR=<path_to_game_files>`

---

### linux/bsd

You may need to run the following commands to install packages (using fresh ubuntu-18.04 installation as example):

* sudo apt install make gcc libcurl4-openssl-dev mesa-common-dev
* sudo apt install libxxf86dga-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev libasound-dev
* sudo apt install libsdl2-dev

Build with: `make`

Copy the resulting binaries from created `build` directory or use command:

`make install DESTDIR=<path_to_game_files>`

---

### raspberry pi os

Install the build dependencies:

* apt install libsdl2-dev libxxf86dga-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

Build with: `make`

Copy the resulting binaries from created `build` directory or use command:

`make install DESTDIR=<path_to_game_files>`

---

### macos

* install the official SDL2 framework to /Library/Frameworks
* `brew install molten-vk` or install Vulkan SDK to use MoltenVK library

Build with: `make`

Copy the resulting binaries from created `build` directory

---

Several make options are available for linux/mingw/macos builds:

`BUILD_CLIENT=1` - build unified client/server executable, enabled by default

`BUILD_SERVER=1` - build dedicated server executable, enabled by default

`USE_SDL=0`- use SDL2 backend for video, audio, input subsystems, disabled by default, enforced for macos

`USE_VULKAN=0` - link client with vulkan renderer instead of OpenGL, disabled by default, works only with single renderer builds

`USE_RENDERER_DLOPEN=1` - do not link single renderer into client binary, compile all renderers (ignoring USE_VULKAN setting) as dynamic libraries and allow to switch them on the fly via `\cl_renderer` cvar, enabled by default

`USE_SYSTEM_JPEG=0` - use current system JPEG library, disabled by default

Example:

`make BUILD_SERVER=0 USE_RENDERER_DLOPEN=0 USE_VULKAN=1` - which means do not build dedicated binary, build client with single static vulkan renderer
